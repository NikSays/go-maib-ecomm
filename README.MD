This library provides tools to interact with MAIB ECommerce in a type safe way.

This library is **UNOFFICIAL**, inspired by public Integration Guide and [implementations](https://github.com/maibank) 
shared by MAIB.

Unlike other implementations, you don't need to run any `openssl` commands to change the certificate's format.
Only the default `.pfx` pkcs#12 file is needed. 

## Installation

Inside your Go module, run
```shell
go get github.com/NikSays/go-maib-ecomm
```

## Documentation

Documentation and examples are available at [Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/NikSays/go-maib-ecomm).

## Testing

If you need to regenerate the testing certificates, run the `./genCrt.sh` script
in the ./testdata folder.

To test the package just run `go test ./... `.
