This library provides tools to interact with MAIB ECommerce in a type safe way.

This library is **UNOFFICIAL**, inspired by public Integration Guide and [implementations](https://github.com/maibank) 
shared by MAIB.

Unlike other implementations, you don't need to run any `openssl` commands to change the certificate's format.
Only the default `.pfx` pkcs#12 file is needed.
