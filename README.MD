This project provides tools to interact with MAIB ECommerce in a type safe way.

This library is an **UNOFFICIAL** implementation, inspired by **public** Integration Guide and
[implementations](https://github.com/maibank) shared by MAIB.

Unlike official implementations, you don't need to run any `openssl`  commands to change the key's format.
Default `.pfx` pkcs12 key works just fine.
